# Discord Clone

I have created a front-end clone of the popular communication platform Discord using HTML and Tailwind CSS. This project focuses on replicating the user interface and visual design of Discord, providing a similar experience for users.

The project features a visually appealing and responsive user interface that mimics the layout and components of Discord. It includes a sign-up and login system that allows users to create accounts and authenticate themselves to access the Discord clone.




## Hosting
I have deployed this project using Netlify. One of the finest source in this business.

#step 1 : 
open the packet.json file and under scripts , create a "build" : "vite build"

#step 2 :
now Run the [ npm run start ] command

#step 3 :
now Run the [ npm run build ] command

#result :
it would automatically generate a DIST folder
